# DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS
## ALGORITHMS

Algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a problem.

### Characteristics
1. Well defined inputs and outputs
2. Each step of the algorithm is clear and unambiguous
3. It should be language independent.

### Efficiency / Performance of an algorithm

The runtime of an algorithm depends on the programming language, the computer used to implememnt the program on, other programs running at the same time quanlity of the operating system.
